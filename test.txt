Test:
======

Make sure you have installed the environment correctly by refereing to setup.txt

Download the reference fine_tune model for cantonese jyutping from https://terabox.com/s/1tX6Ur74n99u0dyf1kq7UNg

copy it to cantoneseASR_jyutping/fairseq/reference_checkpoint/cantonese/fine-tuned/

For inference: Install the flashlight.lib.text and use

“python inference_cantonese_test.py”, user needs to set the parameters inside this file correctly first,

Inside the file, there is a setup of model and data path:

models, task = load_model_and_task(
model_path = “<path to your fine tune model>/checkpoint_best.pt”,
data_dir = “<path to your manifest folder containing the dict file>” # Should contain dict.ltr.txt
)

print(transcribe(models, task, “common_voice_zh-HK_24020802.flac”))

The final function transcribe(models, task, “common_voice_zh-HK_24020802.flac”) is to print the output of inference with the input speech file common_voice_zh-HK_24020802.flac inside the same folder. You can change your own speech file for inference here.
